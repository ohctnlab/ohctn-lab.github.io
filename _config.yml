title: Welcome to Oh Laboratory for Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience!
description: We investigate cognitive and neural bases of human memory and how the memory system changes with both normal and pathological brain aging processes, with a special emphasis on preclinical older adults. We use cognitive neuroscience methods and multimodal neuroimaging techniques such as functional/structural MRI and PET detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology (e.g., amyloid plaques) in vivo. The overarching goal of our research is to understand neurocognitive underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease pathology and develop early behavioral and neural biomarkers that help identify individuals at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other dementia.
